== Description ==

Cooked is the absolute best way to create & display recipes with WordPress. SEO optimized (rich snippets), galleries, cooking timers, printable recipes and much more. Check out the full list below.

Be sure to check out the **[Live Preview](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cooked/?preview=1)** as well as the **[Cooked Wiki](https://github.com/XjSv/Cooked/wiki)** if you need some help!

= Quality design & usability =

Using the drag & drop recipe builder, you can create your recipes quickly and without limitations. Add ingredients, directionsâ€”and then add a gallery, nutrition facts, cooking times and much more.

= Google-friendly =

Cooked automatically includes semantic structure and schema.org microdata into each and every recipe you publish. This allows Google to display your recipes across a variety of device sizes and platforms.

* Drag & drop ingredients and directions.
* SEO Optimized - Google Structured Data and Schema.org support.
* Beautiful grid-based masonry recipe lists.
* Prep & Cooking Times
* Photo Galleries
* Nutrition Facts
* Difficulty Levels
* Recipe Notes

* Author template to list recipes by a single author.
* Cooking times with clickable, interactive timers.
* Very developer-friendly with loads of hooks & filters.
* Servings switcher to adjust ingredient amounts.
* And more to come...

Of course, if you want even more, you can always check out the [PRO](https://cooked.pro) version of Cooked. It adds features like ratings & favorites, recipe submissions, and so much more.
